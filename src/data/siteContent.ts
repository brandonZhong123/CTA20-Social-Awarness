The 2004 Health Accord between the federal government and provinces/territories included a 10-Year Plan on improving Indigenous health, but it expired in 2014 and hasn't been replaced despite repeated promises. The Canadian Health Coalition called the 'lack of progress on closing the health gap for Aboriginal people' the most egregious of the 2004 Health Accord's failings. Indigenous people continue to face 'syndemic' conditions - multiple interacting and mutually aggravating epidemics, worsened by existing negative health determinants due to colonialism."

This complexity means there are effectively 15 different healthcare systems in the country. Although medicare has been a point of Canadian pride since the 1960s, health care has never appeared in the Constitution, either in 1867 or 1982. The Constitution merely delegates jurisdiction for hospitals to the provinces, with no mention of Indigenous peoples or their jurisdiction. The Canada Health Act of 1984 similarly doesn't mention Indigenous peoples, despite the emergence of constitutional Aboriginal rights just years earlier."

As early as 1872, the Peguis First Nation sent an affidavit disputing lack of health care provision promised in Treaty 1. In 1935, Chief George Dreaver took the Crown to court over medical supplies under Treaty 6's medicine chest clause. The 1999 Wuskwi Sipihk Cree Nation decision indicated that the Treaty should include full healthcare in a contemporary context. Notable activists like Jean Cuthand Goodwill, the first Native registered nurse in Saskatchewan, worked for decades to increase Native people's involvement in health care, co-founding the Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association in 1974 and developing numerous Indigenous health programs."

This led to Joyce's Principle, a set of proposals by the Atikamekw Nation and Manawan. In British Columbia, the 'In Plain Sight' report acknowledged systemic Indigenous-specific racism within BC's health care system. However, implementation remains a challenge. Life expectancy for First Nations in BC decreased by two and half years from 2011 to 2017, partly due to the overdose epidemic, even with a First Nations Health Authority in place. The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the longer crisis in Indigenous health."

Canada has yet to ratify the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989, despite its Article 25 ensuring adequate health services for Indigenous peoples. Canada maintains it has no legal or constitutional obligations to provide health services to Indigenous people, claiming it does so only as a matter of policy or 'benevolence.'
