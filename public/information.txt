In 2024, a survey was conducted amongst identifying Indigenous, Metis or Inuit people living off reserve about Canada’s healthcare.

Majority of Aboriginals living off reserves reported it was very important to support Indigenous healthcare practices (86%).
Culturally appropriate care is defined as care that embodies the traditions of a patient’s culture where they can feel respected and valued.
Many indigenous people experiencing discrimination felt that they’re concerns were not valued (67% reported that their health concerns were minimized) 
21% of reported that their cultural protocols were not respected

A quarter of Indigenous people reported that they experienced some sort of discrimination or unfair treatment from a health care professional 
The most reported location of discrimination was in the emergency room
Women were reported to be twice as likely to face some sort of discrimination 
 
Roughly 1 in 5 Indigenous people living off reserve reported  having to travel outside their community to access health care services
Almost half of them travelling outside of their communities had to travel over 500 km
Inuit reported having to travel over 1500 km
47% of First Nations people living off reserves reported needing mental health care. (Factors: Colonial and Assimilative Policies, Intergenerational trauma )
Among those that needed mental health care over three quarters of them reported partially met or unmet

70% of Metis, 66% of First Nations people living off reserves and 52% of inuits consulted a health care provider for non-urgent checkups.
Timely access to healthcare tends to be longer in remote areas among Indigenous people.
Wait times were reported to range from two days to less than 2 weeks. Inuits were more likely to be waiting one month to gain access to a primary healthcare provider.


When asked about health care needs, Indigenous people often experience difficulty getting referrals to specialists and often are not given the correct treatment or perscription. 
Canada’s healthcare is divided into 15 separate systems each with their own jurisdiction; 1 healthcare jurisdiction for each province and territory, the federally funded Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) program for first nations and Inuit and the Metis Programs via Indigenous Services Canada.
This means each hospital operates under its own jurisdiction based on the province. This leads to a more complex and disjointed system for Indigenous people as the federal government is merely responsible for funding leading to international legislation being a grey area. As a result, care and services can be inconsistent or entirely absent. 
For instance, while provinces and territories manage insured health services, the federal government provides supplementary services to First Nations and Inuit through the NIHB program. This dual system can cause confusion over service eligibility and responsibility, leading to delays and barriers in accessing care.
A good example of this is the Canada Health Act (CHA) established in 1984 that include Indigenous coverage that all medically necessary hospital, physician and surgical-dental services are covered. However, the Canada Health Act is a federal legislation but provinces and territories are responsible for administering and their respective health care systems.

Since the 1960s when medicare was implemented, the constitution never appeared in federal Canadian Law either in 1867 when Canada was a Dominion and in 1982, when Canada gained full independence. Instead, the healthcare constitution is merely controlled by the hospitals in the province with no mention of Indigenous people in the jurisdiction. 
The Canada Health Act of 1984 does not mention Indigenous peoples. The health act reaffirms the provincial jurisdiction of healthcare where the federal government is only responsible for funding.

Inuit life expectancy for  males is around 70 years while the average life expectancy is around 80 years
Higher rates of injuries, infectious diseases and substance abuse. The effects of colonization and historical trauma have ever lasting impacts on inuit communities contributing to poorer health and shorter lifespans. 
 
Indigenous people strategically avoid public hospitals, when possible in favour of clinics managed and by Indigenous people.

Although Canada previously developed health policies to Indigenous peoples, a formal enacted legislation for Indigenous health care was never formed. Instead, responsibilities are on reserves to Chiefs and Councils through the Indian act.

Canada is bound by legal obligations through numbered treaties between the Crown and Indigenous nations and the United Nations’ 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which is a binding international treaty
In a 2016 submission to the UN’s Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Maskwacis Cree emphasized Article 12(1) of the ICESCR, which provides a comprehensive commitment to health not merely the absence of disease, but the assurance of conditions necessary for well-being. In essence, it promotes a proactive and holistic approach to health.

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples although not directly about health is a set of international standards rather than a binding law itself, that is meant to provide a framework for Indigenous well-being and reconciliation. 

The Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention is an international treaty that addresses the rights of Indigenous and tribal peoples. 

According to Dr. Mary Jane Logan McCallum, Indigenous people a racialized in multiple ways which results in ill-treatment, differential coverage and negative assumptions. 



Brian Sinclair died in 2008 at the age of 45 after waiting in the emergency room for over 34 hours. 
Brian Sinclar was an off-reserve Indigenous man living in Manitoba.
He had sought care for a blocked catheter after being referred by a family physician. A blocked catheter is a treatable condition that requires timely intervention
Despite presenting a referral from his community clinic, Sinclair was never registered
Staff made assumptions about his status believing he was intoxicated or homeless.
November Kelly, a 25 year old Ojibway mother from OniGaming First Nation, died after experiencing ongoing abdominal pain following a card accident.
Despite her multiple visits to hospitals in Thunder Bay and Fort Frances, her symptoms were dismissed and she was only prescribed medications.
Her conditions worsened over four months until she collapsed on a family trip towards Winnipeg.
She was admitted to the St. Boniface hospital where she died shortly after.
She died of a severe infection caused by a hole in her bowel from the car accident.
Certain groups, including Indigenous peoples, racial and sexual minorities, immigrants, and individuals with functional limitations, experience significant health disparities. These disparities are often linked to social, political, and economic disadvantages.
Lower income, education, and employment levels are associated with poorer health outcomes, such as reduced life expectancy and higher rates of chronic diseases.
Indigenous communities face higher rates of chronic conditions, mental health issues, and infectious diseases like tuberculosis, largely due to historical and systemic factors, including colonialism and systemic discrimination.
Unhealthy behaviours (e.g., smoking, heavy drinking) and substandard living conditions (e.g., inadequate housing, food insecurity) are more prevalent among disadvantaged groups, exacerbating health inequalities.
First nations experience nearly twice the suicide rate of Canadians. The suicide rate among Inuit people is over 11 times the rate of regular Canadian Citizens. Nunavut has the one of the highest suicide rates in the world since 1999. 27% of all deaths have been a result of suicide. Due to the adverse effects of Residential Schools on aboriginal health, it is required that the federal government address these issues
One of the ongoing factors contributing to Aboriginal mental health challenges is forced acculturation. Holistic mental health centres are particularly effective in addressing these issues because studies have shown that Indigenous peoples respond more positively to culturally relevant, holistic approaches. They often view mental wellness as a state of harmony involving family, community, and the environment (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2006).
Our research into various Indigenous mental health programs reveals that many adopt an intersectional approach, combining traditional healing practices such as the medicine wheel, with conventional clinical treatments.
Nunavut’s Addiction and Mental Health Strategy promotes a community-focused model that merges Inuit cultural values, like caring for family and community, with Western scientific methods from biology and psychiatry (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2012, p. 38).
Similarly, the Northwest Territories' strategy, A Shared Path Towards Wellness, uses a "population health approach" that considers mental health as interconnected with physical, spiritu al, social, and cultural well-being (Government of Northwest Territories, 2012).
There is a pressing demand for Indigenous mental health services. While 17% of Indigenous people seek support for mental health concerns—compared to only 8% of the general population—the actual need is likely even higher. Expanding access to culturally sensitive services would greatly benefit these communities (Health Canada, 2000).
Furthermore, collective experiences of trauma may lead to increased reliance on communal coping mechanisms, including spiritual or religious beliefs, which can foster resilience to stress-related conditions (Zarowsky, 2004).


Indigenous peoples in Canada continue to face significant health disparities compared to non-Indigenous populations. These disparities are made worse by limited access to quality health care and lower socio-economic conditions, as outlined by the social determinants of health. In many remote communities, access to proper health services is especially lacking. A 2015 report by the Auditor General of Canada found that Health Canada could not confirm that First Nations individuals in remote areas of Manitoba and Ontario were receiving the clinical care and medical transport services they were entitled to. This highlights a failure to effectively implement current health policies and programs.
A major factor behind poor health outcomes is the presence of racism, particularly systemic racism, within the healthcare system. This issue extends beyond individual acts of discrimination during medical treatment, it is embedded in the very structure of the Canadian health system. Structural racism is reflected in the policies and procedures of public health institutions and related sectors, contributing to barriers in accessing care and worsening health inequalities. Racism also directly harms physical health through:
The stress caused by perceived discriminatory encounters,


Being denied access to appropriate health services,


The harmful effects of internalized stigma and discrimination, and


The mental strain of constantly anticipating negative treatment, which can lead to chronic stress and strained social experiences.
